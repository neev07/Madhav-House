    <h3 class="Akash_Speech"> <b>Mr Akash Sharma </b></h3>
    <p class="hm_t">Madhav House is a vibrant amalgamation of youthful energy and infectious enthusiasm. Joining this house, I was swiftly immersed in the distinctive Madhavian spirit, marked by an unyielding sense of responsibility and an unwavering "can-do" attitude. Stepping into Madhav House, I sensed a unique character in each boy – a quality that remains steadfast within me. Challenges are met with an enthusiastic "Yes" as the boys demonstrate their determination and tenacity. As I embark on my journey with Madhav House, I am optimistic about fostering growth and success among the boys. The website and the Madhav House website is a  glimpses into our house's authentic life, providing insights into our wonderful community. I anticipate the boys of Madhav House achieving greatness, learning from setbacks, and evolving into accomplished individuals. Jai Madhav! Madhav House's uniqueness stems from its connection to Lord Krishna and HH Maharaja Madhav Rao Scindia. Situated opposite the principal's residence, the house benefits from his valuable guidance and proximity to Astachal, enriching students' experiences. The house's motto, "MAD Makes a Difference," encapsulates its transformative impact on students' lives across leadership, academics, sports, and more. Celebrating the school's 125th anniversary, Madhav House has nurtured remarkable talents like Aditya Singh – a senior school prefect – and Keshav Bhagat – a band leader, chess captain and school prefect.

    <h2 class="hm_text">Resident Tutor's Message</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <img src="image/rt.jpeg" class="hm" alt="iphone-mockup">
    </div>

        <h3 class="Akash_Speech "> <b>Mr Chetan Bhatia</b> </h3>
      <p class="hm_t">The name Madhav embodies the essence of our school, a tribute to the esteemed Maharaja Sir Madhao Rao Scindia. Rooted in tradition, our House thrives on the principles of our visionary founders. With dedication, we uphold the legacy of excellence they instilled in this institution. Just as Madhao Rao Scindia's legacy continues to inspire, we, the residents of Madhav House, strive to exemplify his spirit of leadership, learning, and service. Let us carry forward this heritage, fostering unity and success within our House and the school community. Together, we shape our future while honoring our remarkable past.

        <br>“ Be Bold In What You Stand For ”

      <br>Proud Madhavian !</p><br>

    <h2 class="hm_text">Why Madhav?</h2>
    <p class="Madhav_Desc">

      There is something that separates Madhav House from the
    lot, and it is not something like its spirit, history of
    achievements, or glory. But rather, it is just the name itself,
    which when
    which when associated with students, makes them
    genuinely work harder and pushes them to have a problem-
    solving approach towards things which in turn results in
    collective success.
    <br>
    <br>Madhav has a streak of remaining on top, but more
    importantly, it has the strongest of value systems. The
    character this house helps build of its students is the
    paragon of the character itself. Madhav teaches its students
    camaraderie and strong values and it teaches them to be
    bold while standing up for those values. So, there is no
    answer as to why Madhav, but rather a set of ideals that
    everyone can relate to.
