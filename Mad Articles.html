        <h2 class="Article_head"> As The Motto Says...</h2>
        <h6 class="Article_head">By Ayaan Shah</h6>
          <p class="Sets_Para">Be bold in what you stand for...
            Never have words so profound and
            impactful been uttered in this world- or
            maybe they have. The famous motto still is
            revered by all of Madhav House regardless.
            To be bold refers to an innate human urge
            to stand up for yourself, whether in your
            morals, values, or ideals. So easily buried by
            cultural anxiety to please others it is often
            forgotten by the masses, to hold yourself
            high and speak up when you should. Madhav
            has always understood the importance of
            this ideal.
            <br>
            <br> Madhavians are bold, in every aspect of
            their lives, and never afraid to speak up for
            what they believe in. We as a culture
            sometimes attribute our belief in ourselves
            as a demerit, but when cultivated as a
            quality it can be one's greatest gift.
            Madhavians steer clear of the pompous ego,
            and rather embody self-respect, one that
            lifts both others and ourselves The mere
            action leaves such an impact on our lives.
            We walk taller, live happier, and dream
            bigger.
          <br>
          <br>
          We at Madhav value boldness over
          everything else, and I hope you readers now
          understand its importance as a skill. As a
          Scindian before a Madhavian, I personally
          value the Madhavian trait moreover, it
          shows me how a little something can open
          so many doors of opportunities. It helps us
          create a better community when we make
          known our craving for well-deserved respect
          and give it to each other too. Madhav,
          before all, is a strong community of such
          bold individuals.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our boldness is synonymous with the
          Madhavian ethos, and it reflects in our every
          action. Even when the mundane crushing
          pressure of societal expectation is removed.
          we spring to life living it with our hundred
          percent. In essence, to be bold is to be
          Madhavian. and I wouldn't change that for
          the world. If nothing. Madhav represents the
          importance of taking a step and realizing-
          you know what, I do have admirable skills
          and qualities, and I deserve to be
          appreciated for them. And the same can be
          said for our appreciation of others, with
          boldness comes respect and compassion, in
          which Madhav also excels.

        <h2 class="Article_head">Religion - What is it?</h2>
        <h6 class="Article_head">By Kavin Singh</h6>
        <p class="Sets_Para">
         Our school had hosted the Scindian TalkHouse on the

          topic "Religion is a myth". It was a very

          successful event and created many

          opinions in our minds. For me, it was a

          mixed conclusion which is that religion is

          not a myth but people who are controlling it

          use myths to gain support. Before
          explaining my theory I would request the

          readers to know that this is just my

          personal opinion based on my observation

          and not something everyone must agree

          upon.
          <br>
          <br>
          During that interactive session of 2 hours,
          there were multiple opinions put forward by
          the participants on stage. Some of them
          believed that religion is an umbrella term

          consisting of cultures, traditions and ethics

          percolated down generation after

          generation, while others related religion

          directly to God. In my humble opinion,
          religion is what binds us all together

          because lets be honest, at the end of the
          day, all religions propagate peace, unity,
          brotherhood, and compassion. I remember
          an incident from my childhood where my
          father taught me to bow my head not only
          front of a Gurudwara but also in front of a

          temple, mosque or any holy place. These

          teachings have made me a more humble,

          more amicable, more enlightened and more

          considerate.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of the views, that I really found interesting
          was presented by now Senior School Prefect Aditya Singh. He
          emphasised that religion does not necessarily
          revolve around the existence or nonexistence of
          God, rather it is a broader term which has more
          to do with our way of living on an everyday

          basis. It provides us with a necessary discipline

          which gives a healthy structure to our lives.

          More importantly, it helps keep our traditions
          alive. Religions are a set of value-systems

          which, more or less, put forward the same goal
          of the development of mankind. But still, I still
          ponder over these questions during the solemn
          hours of night that is there a God, is there a
          religion or it is just a made up concept in order
          to segregate us?

        <h2 class="Article_head">Importance Of Seniority in a Residential School</h2>
        <h6 class="Article_head">By Rudransh Agarwal</h6>
        <p class="Sets_Para">
          S o to start with this topic I would like to highlight the keywords of the topic which are; SENIORITY and RESIDENTIAL. Residential means a boarding school or a place where people 'reside' that is to live. Seniority refers to a system where the seniors by class are to be respected by their juniors. So, seniority is mostly taken as a form of ragging in a boarding or a residential school, and that is not the juniors mistake or a mistake of a parent as an image has been formed of seniors as the type of people who make others do their work and trouble them. But I would disagree with that. Seniors in a boarding school are one of the most advantageous parts of a boarding school. There are many reasons for that. I take seniors as a past form of our current life as they have lived what we currently are, and they do know what is the best for us. They have lived every aspect of our life and in the same place because at the end of the day they are only your seniors if you are in the same school. So, they know where you have problems and where you need improvement in your life. If they make you run, they do to it make you fit and eventually in your life you will realise that how important is good health. They ask us to be punctual for roll call because they don't want us to be late in life. They ask you to get something for them, as later in life you will learn the importance of resource-management and the skill of arranging things on spot. There are many more examples of the advantages of having seniors in a school. Suppose your housemaster or any teacher is not well or cannot be with you to solve your problems seniors can be there in place of them and support you as well as them and if one senior is not well there is always another one present to help you.
          Being a Housemaster is very tough and no doubt that Housemasters have done a phenomenal job over a period but taking care of teenage boys and not just 1 but 50 of them! It is an exceedingly difficult job, I mean parents have problems taking care of two children, so no doubt they do an amazing job, but seniors take care of us when the Housemaster cannot be there. In the case of inter-house competitions, they push us to our limits, and we can go to them for help regarding our career or any other help in general. But despite all this help we still tend to complain and not give them as much respect as they deserve only because we are not comfortable with becoming strong.

        <br>
        <br>So, with this, I would say that seniors are specially important In a residential school with one more example. The biggest example I would believe is The Scindia School itself, the old boys of the Scindia School come back to the school to guide us and exhibit that how these qualities of being a true Scindian have helped them in shaping their successful and illustrious careers. We aspire to be like them and walk in their footprints.

        <h2 class="Article_head">What makes an ideal Chief Executive Officer?        </h2>
        <h6 class="Article_head">By Arsh Agarwal</h6>
        <p class="Sets_Para">

          The work of any CEO requires strenuous efforts in their respective line of work. The work they have to do on a daily basis is vital for the survival of their respective company or organization. Whether it be delegating or driving profitability they must ensure the work they do is efficient. A CEO acts as the bridge between employees and the board of the company they manage. So the question arises, What makes an ideal Chief Executive Officer?

         <br><br> Now a CEO is always under constant pressure to corroborate that the performance of the company is at the highest level. Therefore, they have to keep their composure in the direst of circumstances. A calm and composed CEO will be able to make decisions better. Talking about decisions, a CEO should also possess a decision-making ability like no other. Every CEO has to take crucial decisions during their tenure, and one wrong decision could cost them their job and for the company, its credibility and relevance. As mentioned above, a CEO manages the company and a company is not a company without employees. A CEO is expected to look after the satisfaction and morale of employees. If the employee is not happy with them or not satisfied with the company as a whole, an ideal CEO should guide the employee to take the correct decision and act as a leader. If the CEO is not a good leader, they will fail in their responsibility as a chief. If the CEO is not able to understand the view of the employee, he will not be able to guide him/her. So, a CEO should also be well versed in their communicative prowess, as communicating will be a key factor if they expect to reel in top investors and clients to join the project of their company. If the CEO wants to have good communication skills they should be exuding confidence every time they represent their company in meetings with business partners or investors. A confident CEO will look approachable to clients and help them visualize the reliability of the company. If the CEO is not confident in themselves, they create a bad impression on the targeted consumer group as well as the clients.

         <br><br> Lastly, I would like to say that CEO is a position that comes with its fair share of authority and responsibilities and a lack of desire and hard work will mean that the person is not suitable for that position. So it is bad for the person who wants to head a company to not be strong in even one of these qualities, as it results in the work of a CEO being futile.
