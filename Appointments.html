        <p class="prefect_text">Dear Madhavians,

With profound reverence and pride, I take this moment to proclaim the magnitude and grandeur of this epoch-making event and congratulate all of you on the culmination of 125 years of our institution.

In the storied history of this institution, our house has served as a producer of strong men of character and chivalry. Ours is a firm pledge of being bold in what we stand for and that has led our way all these years. We boast of a value-system that is unparalleled and a legacy of sheer brilliance. I am immensely proud of who we are and even prouder of who we are going to be.

I’m blessed to have the honour of holding the office of the Senior School Prefect on this singular year and I am grateful to my house for building me from the ground up. I aim to give my best in all aspects and help Madhav reach even greater heights.

From the very beginning, when I had joined in Junior School, I was attracted to Madhav House for its prowess and dominance in various fields. I fought to get into Madhav House and every second here has been worth it. Madhav has always been about making a difference and that is what I have always wished to do.

This year, let’s do what we do best, let’s lead and let’s raise the bar. Let’s do it all with unforeseen enthusiasm and unmatched energy. Let’s be bold in what we stand for and let’s go out there and make a difference.

Jai Madhav!

        <p class="prefect_text">Dear Madhavians,


          As we roam around the house, we are reminded of the tapestry of experiences, dreams, and aspirations that bind the madhavians together. I won’t hesitate in saying this, rather would be proud to appreciate that our house is not just a group; or a bunch of fellas but a family thriving to uplift its members. Each one of the Madhavians bring with them a unique story but share a common purpose of excellence and growth and are known as <b>MAD </b>which stands for Makes A Difference.


          I, as the Prefect of this School am honoured to represent a house so diverse and vibrant. And as the Chess Captain and Band Leader of the school, I have consistently endeavored to guide and unify our students, aiming to lead our house towards glory.


          When I first stepped into Madhav House in the 8th class, I was filled with uncertainty, unsure of how I would find my place or face the challenges ahead. Yet, it was the heartbeat of this house, its ethos, and the unwavering support of each member that built me, guiding my transformation from a hesitant student to the individual I am proud to be today. This house did not just provide a shelter; it shaped my character, resilience, and spirit.<br> Thank you for being the foundation of my journey.
